Numpy has a built in Least Square Method in its linear algebra library. 

X value - Numpy expects a two-dimensional array, the first dimension is the different example values and the second dimension
is the attribute number.
In this case, we have our value as the mean number of rooms per house and this is a single attribute so the second dimension 
of the array is just 1. So, we'll need to create a (506,1) shape array. Using numpy's built-in vertical stack tool.
