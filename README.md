# LinearRegressionExamples

In this simple Linear Regression model, we use the data set with outliers and understand Outlier Treatment

Outlier Treatment Methods:
1) Capping and Flooring :
* Impute all the values above 3* P99 and below 0.3* P1
* Impute with values 3* P99 and 0.3* P1
* You can use any multiplier instead of 3, as per your business

2) Exponential smoothing 
* Extrapolate curve between P95 and P99 and cap all the values falling outside to the value generated by the curve
* Similarly, extrapolate curve between P5 and P1

3) Sigma Approach 
* Identigy outliers by capturing all the values falling outside u+-xsigma
* You can use any multiplier as x, as per your business requirement.
